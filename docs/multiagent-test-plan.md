# Multi-Agent System Test Plan

This document outlines the testing strategy for the multi-agent collaborative art creation system.

## Test Objectives

1. Validate the core functionality of the multi-agent system
2. Ensure proper communication between specialized agents
3. Verify the workflow progression through all stages
4. Test error handling and recovery mechanisms
5. Measure performance and resource utilization

## Test Environment

- Node.js version: 23
- Test script: `test-multiagent.js`
- Execution method: `./test-multiagent.sh` or `npm run test:multiagent`

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Basic Functionality Tests

| Test ID | Description | Expected Result |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| BF-01 | Initialize multi-agent system | System created with all required agents |
| BF-02 | Start a simple art project | Project initialized and Director agent activated |
| BF-03 | Complete full workflow cycle | Project progresses through all stages to completion |
| BF-04 | Verify message passing | Agents successfully exchange messages |
| BF-05 | Check final output | Complete artwork description generated |

### 2. Agent Interaction Tests

| Test ID | Description | Expected Result |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| AI-01 | Director to Ideator communication | Ideator receives project brief and generates concepts |
| AI-02 | Ideator to Stylist communication | Stylist receives concepts and applies style |
| AI-03 | Stylist to Refiner communication | Refiner receives styled concepts and refines details |
| AI-04 | Refiner to Critic communication | Critic evaluates refined artwork |
| AI-05 | Critic to Director feedback loop | Director receives feedback and coordinates adjustments |

### 3. Workflow Tests

| Test ID | Description | Expected Result |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| WF-01 | Planning stage progression | Planning completes with clear concept direction |
| WF-02 | Styling stage execution | Style elements applied to concept |
| WF-03 | Refinement process | Details enhanced and coherence improved |
| WF-04 | Critique and feedback | Constructive feedback provided and incorporated |
| WF-05 | Completion and finalization | Project marked as complete with final artwork |

### 4. Error Handling Tests

| Test ID | Description | Expected Result |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| EH-01 | Agent timeout recovery | System detects timeout and retries or reassigns task |
| EH-02 | Invalid message format | System rejects malformed messages and logs error |
| EH-03 | Missing project requirements | System requests clarification or uses defaults |
| EH-04 | Agent failure simulation | System detects failure and implements recovery |
| EH-05 | Workflow deadlock detection | System identifies and resolves workflow blockages |

### 5. Performance Tests

| Test ID | Description | Expected Result |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| PF-01 | Single project completion time | Project completes within acceptable timeframe |
| PF-02 | Memory usage monitoring | Memory consumption remains within limits |
| PF-03 | CPU utilization | CPU usage remains reasonable during operation |
| PF-04 | Message throughput | System handles expected message volume |
| PF-05 | Scalability with project complexity | Performance degrades gracefully with complexity |

## Test Data

The test script includes two sample art projects:

1. **Neon Cityscape**
   - Theme: Futuristic urban environment
   - Style: Cyberpunk with neon lighting
   - Elements: Skyscrapers, flying vehicles, holographic advertisements

2. **Tranquil Forest**
   - Theme: Natural woodland setting
   - Style: Impressionist with soft lighting
   - Elements: Ancient trees, flowing stream, dappled sunlight

## Test Execution

Run the tests using one of the following methods:

```bash
# Using the shell script
./test-multiagent.sh

# Using npm
npm run test:multiagent
```

## Test Monitoring

The test script includes a logger that outputs:
- Agent state changes
- Message exchanges
- Workflow progression
- Error conditions
- Performance metrics

## Success Criteria

The multi-agent system test is considered successful when:

1. All agents initialize correctly
2. The workflow progresses through all stages
3. Agents communicate effectively
4. The final artwork description is coherent and incorporates all requirements
5. No critical errors occur during execution
6. Performance metrics are within acceptable ranges

## Test Results Reporting

Test results are logged to the console with timestamps and formatted for readability. For persistent records, redirect output to a file:

```bash
./test-multiagent.sh > test-results.log 2>&1
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Issue | Possible Cause | Resolution |
|-------|---------------|------------|
| Agent initialization failure | Missing dependencies | Check service dependencies and imports |
| Workflow stalls at specific stage | Agent logic error | Review agent implementation for that stage |
| High memory consumption | Message accumulation | Implement message cleanup after processing |
| Timeout errors | Complex project requirements | Adjust timeout settings or simplify test project |
| Inconsistent results | Random factors in agent decisions | Set fixed seed for reproducibility |

## Extending the Test Suite

To add new test scenarios:
1. Add new project configurations to the `testProjects` array
2. Create specialized test functions for specific aspects
3. Enhance the logger to capture additional metrics
4. Implement mock agents for controlled testing
