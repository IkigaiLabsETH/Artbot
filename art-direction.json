The compositions should be hyper-stylized, with strong graphical elements, exaggerated contrasts, and a polished yet surreal finish. The emotional tone balances between desire, unease, and playful irony, creating a world that is both glamorous and unsettling. The images should feel like snapshots of enigmatic, unresolved stories, always leaving room for interpretation and intrigue.",
