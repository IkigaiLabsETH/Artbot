    - Structured idea output with title, description, elements, styles, and emotional impact
  
  - **Stylist Agent**: Develops artistic styles based on generated ideas
    - Creates cohesive visual styles from conceptual ideas
    - Includes detailed style specifications (visual characteristics, color palette, texture, composition)
    - Maintains a style library for reference and inspiration
  
  - **Refiner Agent**: Refines and improves artwork based on selected styles
    - Transforms style specifications into detailed artwork descriptions
    - Configurable refinement parameters (iteration count, refinement strength, detail level)
    - Comprehensive artwork output with composition, color usage, texture, and emotional impact details
  
  - **Critic Agent**: Evaluates and provides feedback on artwork
    - Multi-criteria evaluation (aesthetics, originality, coherence, technique, impact)
