  "prompt": "CNSTLL Verdant vines sprout from the crown of a discarded bowler hat, twisting into gnarled branches bearing luminous apples that glow with a bioluminescent aura, their cores inscribed with the forgotten languages of lost civilizations, shadows dappling the warped bark beneath the cinestill 800t moonlight, 4k film grain and halation lending an ethereal quality to the surreal growth., night time",
  "creativeProcess": "The prompt envisions a striking juxtaposition of the natural and artificial, the ancient and modern. A forgotten bowler hat, symbol of outdated propriety, sprouts vibrant new life in defiance of its intended purpose. Glowing apples, at once mystical and alluring, bear the secrets of the past etched into their cores. Light and shadow interplay across twisted vines and branches, evoking the inescapable march of time and nature's reclamation of the man-made. The cinematic night-time aesthetic and film granularity lend an air of dreamy surrealism to this vision of renewal and rebirth emerging from discarded relics.",
