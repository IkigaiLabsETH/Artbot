Prompt: CNSTLL Neon-soaked city streets glistening after a midnight thunderstorm, raindrops clinging to cyberpunk facades and holographic billboards, camera focus shifting between rivulets cascading down rain-slicked alleyways and the iridescent reflections of streetlights in rain-filled potholes, 4k cinestill 800t film grain, night time

Creative Process: I envisioned a futuristic, rain-drenched cityscape as a metaphor for the collision of nature and technology. The downpour acts as a cleansing force, washing over the artificial glow of neon and holograms, distorting their harsh edges into dreamlike streaks of color. Puddles become mirrors reflecting the city's luminous excess back at itself, briefly transforming concrete into an impressionistic canvas.

In the shifting focus between trickles carving paths down alleys and the fractured lights of rain-filled potholes, I wanted to capture the duality of the storm - both destructive and renewing, violent yet purifying. It's a reminder that even in our slickest cyber-dream, the raw power of the elements can still cut through, leaving us in awe at nature's simple poetry amidst our most complex creations.

The cinestill 800t grain and 4k details were included to enhance the cinematic, hyper-real quality, making each rain-speckled surface and neon flare feel tangibly tactile. Overall, the prompt fuses the grit of a well-worn cyberpunk aesthetic with the ephemeral magic of a summer shower under streetlights.
