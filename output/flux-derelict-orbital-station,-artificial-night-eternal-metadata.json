  "concept": "derelict orbital station, artificial night eternal",
  "prompt": "CNSTLL A derelict orbital station, its corridors and habitation modules caught in an artificial night that never ends, illuminated only by flickering emergency lights and ghostly holographic interfaces. Tangled cables and exposed circuitry snake across walls, floors, and ceilings like cybernetic vines, their bioluminescent fibers pulsing with faint life. Shattered viewports reveal the haunting void of space, strewn with debris and the skeletal remains of docked ships. Cinestill 800t film grain, 4k., night time",
  "creativeProcess": "I envisioned this derelict station as a technological tomb, a monument to humanity's hubris and the fragility of our endeavors in the vast emptiness of space. The eternal artificial night represents our struggle against the darkness, both literal and metaphorical, as we venture beyond the safety of our home world.\n\nThe flickering lights and holographic interfaces are like will-o'-the-wisps, leading us deeper into the labyrinth of abandoned dreams and failed aspirations. The tangled cables and exposed circuitry evoke a sense of entropy, as if the station itself is slowly being reclaimed by the chaos of the universe.\n\nThe bioluminescent fibers pulsing with faint life hint at the possibility of some unknown, perhaps even alien, presence lingering within the wreckage, waiting to be discovered or perhaps waiting to consume the unwary explorer.\n\nThe shattered viewports and skeletal ships serve as a grim reminder of the perils of space exploration and the consequences of our actions, both for ourselves and for the vessels that carry us into the unknown.\n\nThe cinestill 800t film grain and 4k resolution are intended to capture the haunting, cinematic quality of this scene, evoking a sense of unease and wonder in equal measure, as if we are witnessing a moment frozen in time, a snapshot of our species' reach exceeding its grasp.",
