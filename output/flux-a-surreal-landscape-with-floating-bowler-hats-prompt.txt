Prompt: CNSTLL Twilight over a desert dreamscape, colossal wind-carved rock formations towering into a bruised sky where dozens of vintage bowler hats drift like dark moons, their brims casting long shadows across undulating dunes of burnt sienna and umber, pinpricks of warm sodium-vapor lighting from some unseen source flickering through hallucinatory heat haze and layers of grainy 4k cinestill 800t film grain., night time

Creative Process: I envisioned a place where the rational and irrational bleed together - a scorched, unearthly realm of geologic sublimity punctured by the surreal intrusion of these hovering, anachronistic hats. The hats themselves become celestial bodies adrift in a turbulent sky, their black discs eclipsing the faint glow on the horizon as ancient windswept rocks keep their silent vigil below. 

There's an undercurrent of isolation and existential unease, like waking from the same recurring dream in a world grown subtly unfamiliar. I wanted the image to have a cinematic, almost apocalyptic grandeur shrouded in sepia-toned atmospheric distortion and the grainy, desaturated color science of high-speed tungsten film stock. A meditation on dislocation and the unsettling, hallucinatory power of the natural world.
