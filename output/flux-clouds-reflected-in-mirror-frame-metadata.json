  "concept": "Clouds reflected in mirror frame",
  "prompt": "CNSTLL Oil painting with visible brushwork of a mirror frame hanging on a canvas wall, reflecting not the room but a surreal sky filled with billowing clouds. The mirror's ornate wooden frame should have a traditional carved design and aged patina. Use Magritte's distinctive muted color palette with blues, grays and earth tones. Incorporate elements of canvas texture, impasto brush strokes and alla prima painting techniques to create a rich, painterly style reminiscent of traditional oils on canvas., traditional art, visible brushstrokes, non-photorealistic",
  "creativeProcess": "This prompt aims to evoke the dreamlike, metaphysical quality present in much of Magritte's work by juxtaposing the mundane object of a mirror frame with the surreal image of clouds being reflected instead of the room. The mirror represents themes of perception, reality and illusion that Magritte often explored.\n\nThe aged wooden frame and canvas wall textures ground the image in a tangible, material reality, while the cloudscape offers an ethereal, imaginary counterpoint. Magritte's muted color palette and visible brushwork lend the image a sense of vintage nostalgic charm.\n\nBy combining realistic representation of materials like wood and canvas with the implausible reflected clouds, the prompt creates a fascinating tension between the physical and conceptual realms. The painterly techniques reinforce the handcrafted nature of the image as an art object to be contemplated.",
