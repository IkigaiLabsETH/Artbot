  "prompt": "CNSTLL Oil painting of a person standing in a desolate, surreal landscape with muted green hills rolling in the distance. Their face is completely obscured by a large green apple that hovers in front of them, casting intricate brushstroke shadows across their body. The apple's skin has a thick, textured oil paint quality with visible brushwork and a deep green hue. The figure's clothing is rendered in loose, expressive strokes with muted earth tones against the dull sky. Canvas texture and visible brushstrokes give the scene a traditional painterly aesthetic reminiscent of Magritte's distinctive style., traditional art, painterly style, non-photorealistic",
  "creativeProcess": "This prompt aims to capture the dreamlike, metaphorical quality present in many of Magritte's paintings by depicting a simple yet surreal scene - a human figure with their face obscured by a large, floating green apple. The juxtaposition of the mundane apple with the obscured identity creates an air of mystery and philosophical questioning about perception and reality.\n\nThe desolate landscape setting, with its muted color palette and thick, textured brushwork, evokes a sense of isolation and unreality. The emphasis on visible brushstrokes, canvas texture, and oil painting techniques directly references Magritte's own painterly style.\n\nBy obscuring the figure's face, the apple becomes a symbolic stand-in for their identity, suggesting themes of truth being obscured or the familiar made strange. The rich metaphorical layering invites the viewer to ponder deeper meanings beneath the simple, surreal image.",
