  "concept": "Silhouette filled with night sky",
  "prompt": "CNSTLL A towering silhouette of a solitary figure stands against the dusky horizon, their form an inky void filled with swirling galaxies and twinkling stars. Smoky tendrils of the Milky Way spiral within their chest, celestial dust clouds billowing through their outstretched arms. Vivid auroras dance across their face, cosmic rays streaking through their eyes like shooting stars. Faint film grain and light leaks add a nostalgic, cinematic quality. 4k, cinestill 800t., night time",
  "creativeProcess": "This prompt envisions the human form as a vessel for the vast, sublime mysteries of the cosmos. The silhouette serves as a canvas onto which the grandeur of the night sky is projected, inverting our perspective so that the boundless universe exists within us. By filling the void with vivid astronomical details, it suggests we each contain entire galaxies waiting to be uncovered and explored. The dynamic auroras and celestial rays convey a sense of energy and life force emanating from within. The cinematic treatment evokes a dreamy, nostalgic feeling of wonder at the infinite unknown we all encompass.",
