Creative Process: I envisioned the city at night as a living tapestry, woven from thousands of individual lives and stories. The glowing windows represent the solitary struggles, passions and regrets burning in each soul, tiny flickering flames against the void. The swirling cinestill grain evokes the hazy line between dreams and reality in those late night hours. And the tarnished art deco gargoyles are impassive witnesses, ancient gatekeepers to this modern cathedral of insomnia and yearning. It's a love letter to the dreamers and insomniacs, those who find inspiration or torment in the night's endless possibilities.
