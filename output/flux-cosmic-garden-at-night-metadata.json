  "prompt": "CNSTLL Forgotten seeds of stardust sprout into a cosmic garden at night, delicate tendrils of celestial flora twisting upwards from fertile soil of nebula clouds, 4k cinestill 800t night vision grain revealing intricate fractal patterns within each bioluminescent petal and stem, earthly dewdrops replaced by liquid starlight beading on the galactic vegetation, a distant supernova explosion illuminating this secret astral nursery in ethereal indigo and ultraviolet., film grain, night time",
  "creativeProcess": "I envisioned a hidden galactic ecosystem thriving in the fertile dust and energy of deep space. Like a mythological realm where the very seeds of creation take root and blossom into living constellations. There's an ethereal, alien beauty to these extraterrestrial flora - their forms somewhere between the geometric precision of fractals and the flowing elegance of jellyfish tendrils. \n\nThe cosmic garden feels sacred, a place where the raw ingredients of existence cultivate into brilliant new life under the nurturing glow of stellar nurseries and dying suns. I wanted to capture that delicate moment of rebirth and regeneration at the intersection of destruction and growth, death and renewal. The soft indigo hues and cinematic grain give it an almost dreamlike quality, like something barely perceptible at the edge of the night vision spectrum. A secret garden of stardust, waiting to be discovered among the vast unknown.",
