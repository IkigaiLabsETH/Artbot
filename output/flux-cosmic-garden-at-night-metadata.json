  "prompt": "CNSTLL 4k cosmic garden at night, nebula flowers blooming in dark matter soil, milky way vines winding around celestial trees, supernovae bursting like fireworks in indigo skies, cinestill 800t film grain, moonlight photosynthesis, night time",
  "creativeProcess": "I envisioned a secret garden that only blossoms when the universe goes dark - a place where the building blocks of existence take on botanical forms. The flowers are swirling galaxies born from the ashes of dead stars, their petals made of interstellar dust. Vines of ionized gas wrap around trunks of neutron matter, glowing faintly with the light of a million suns compressed into a single point. \n\nSupernovae burst in patterns across the night sky, their explosive blooms showering stardust over this hidden cosmic nursery. The soil itself is woven from strands of dark energy, cradling the roots that tap into the unseen currents holding our reality together. And under the soft moonlight, these extraordinary botanicals photosynthesize not just light, but the fundamental forces of the universe itself.\n\nIt's a place where the cycle of cosmic life plays out in floral metaphors - birth, growth, death, and rebirth unfolding in a single transcendent garden. By cloaking it in the distinctive tones of cinestill nighttime film, I hoped to capture the feeling of an undiscovered paradise waiting to be unveiled by the first human eyes to wander across its cloaked, celestial beauty.",
