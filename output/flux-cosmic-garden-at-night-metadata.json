  "prompt": "CNSTLL A secret midnight garden suspended in the void, tendrils of celestial vines entwined with shimmering constellations, glowing buds blossoming into supernovas against an infinite backdrop of film grain and nebulous clouds, fractal patterns rippling across dewy petals as if refracting the universe itself, streaks of deep indigo and ultraviolet piercing the inky blackness with electric radiance., cinestill 800t, night time, 4k",
  "creativeProcess": "This prompt envisions a surreal, metaphysical paradise existing outside the boundaries of our reality - a place where the cosmic and terrestrial intertwine. The garden becomes a microcosm reflecting the infinite complexity of the universe, with celestial flora drawing life from the very stars that birthed them. \n\nThere's an undercurrent of duality, with the juxtaposition of vibrant blooms against the void evoking a sense of life's resilience amidst the abyss. The fractal patterns and refracted light suggest an underlying order and intelligence to this strange ecosystem.\n\nBy incorporating the technical elements of film grain, color streaking, and 4k cinematic quality, the night scene takes on an almost tangible atmosphere - you can imagine the velvety textures of petals beaded with cosmic dew, the crisp chill of deep space, and the electric crackle of stellar radiation giving the blossoms their radiant glow.\n\nUltimately, it's a meditation on the poetry and mysticism of the natural world, a phantasmagoric dreamscape where the gardens of our world cross-pollinate with the gardens of the heavens. An oasis of transcendent beauty amidst the fathomless unknown.",
