  "creativeProcess": "I envisioned these mysterious figures as manifestations of the storm itself, born from the chaotic energies churning within the clouds. Their bowler hats and human-like shapes suggest a duality - part elemental force, part corporeal being. Are they omens, guardians, or something in between? The lightning veins give them an electric, unstable quality, as if they could dissipate back into the ether at any moment. The glowing eyes hint at an inscrutable intelligence or awareness. By having them emerge from the storm, it creates a sense of the uncanny - the familiar human form made unfamiliar and unsettling by its ethereal, cloud-like composition. The night sky backdrop allows the lightning and glowing details to stand out starkly against the darkness. Overall, it aims to capture a haunting, atmospheric vision of the line between the natural and supernatural.",
