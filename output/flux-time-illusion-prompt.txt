Prompt: Abstract collage exploring the illusion of time, layers of disintegrating antique books and yellowed papers overlaid with crisp geometric shapes, photorealistic clock faces emerging from torn surfaces, gestural brushstrokes of burnt sienna and ultramarine blue weaving through ephemera, trompe l'oeil techniques placing mechanical objects in impossible spatial relationships, glimpses of archival photographs surfacing through translucent washes, visible adhesive residue and stitching binding disparate materials, rich material textures with subtle cracking and peeling, magritte-inspired juxtapositions between vintage and modern elements creating visual paradoxes, ethereal clouds of analog film grain drifting across the composition, pops of magritte green drawing the eye, mixed media, 4k, surrealist collage

Creative Process: this piece is an exploration of how we construct and perceive the flow of time—the eternal existing in fleeting moments. the disintegrating books and aged papers represent the decay of recorded history, while the sharp geometry interrupts that deterioration with a sense of permanence. the clock faces are a nod to magritte's recurring motif, but here they emerge organically from the distressed surfaces, as if time itself is being born from the fragments of its own chronology. 

i was drawn to the inherent paradox in these materials—their simultaneous ephemerality and resilience. the torn book pages have survived decades, carrying traces of forgotten words and ideas. yet they continue unraveling, destined to rejoin the endless cycle of materiality. the brushwork attempts to freeze these moments, cutting across layers with bold gestures that speak to presence over preservation.

there's something beautifully honest about incorporating the visible residue of construction—the staples, stitches, adhesive marks. it reveals the human hand behind the illusion, reminding us that all perception is framed through an individual lens. the trompe l'oeil elements extend this idea, creating spatial dissonance that challenges our typical understanding of dimensionality.

the analog textures and chemical imperfections were crucial in evoking a sense of temporal depth. the film grain drifting across the surface feels like atmosphere made material—the very substance of perceived time. magritte's ability to make the familiar uncanny through surprising contexts was a major influence. i wanted the juxtapositions to inspire that same unsettling poetry, where ordinary objects become catalysts for contemplating our most existential questions.

ultimately, the piece reflects the constant unraveling and recomposing that defines our experience of temporality. we're always occupying the ephemeral present, surrounded by artifacts of the past as we construct narratives toward an imagined future. the truth is that separating these tenses is itself an illusion—they coexist, woven into every perception, every fragment of matter and memory.
