# ArtBot Reference Images Collection

This directory contains a curated collection of reference images that serve as inspiration for the ArtBot's creative process. These images represent the artistic styles, themes, and aesthetics that we want the ArtBot to explore and build upon.

## Purpose

- Provide visual guidance for the ArtBot's creative direction
- Establish a foundation of artistic styles that align with our vision
- Serve as training examples for style evolution algorithms
- Create a visual vocabulary that the ArtBot can reference and expand upon

## Organization

The reference images are organized into the following categories:

- **abstract/**: Non-representational art focusing on colors, shapes, and forms
- **figurative/**: Art that depicts recognizable objects, figures, or scenes
- **landscape/**: Natural and urban landscape imagery
- **portrait/**: Human and character portraits
- **conceptual/**: Art that communicates specific ideas or concepts
- **surreal/**: Dreamlike, fantastical, or impossible imagery
- **geometric/**: Art based on geometric shapes and patterns
- **organic/**: Art inspired by natural, flowing forms
- **digital/**: Art created with digital tools and techniques
- **traditional/**: Art created with traditional media (painting, drawing, etc.)

## Usage Guidelines

1. **File Format**: Preferably use high-quality PNG or JPG files
2. **Naming Convention**: Use descriptive names that include key attributes (e.g., `vibrant_abstract_geometric_001.png`)
3. **Metadata**: Consider adding a companion JSON file for each image with additional metadata (artist, year, style attributes, etc.)
4. **Copyright**: Ensure all images are either original, licensed for this use, or in the public domain

## Integration with ArtBot

The ArtBot system can access these reference images through the following mechanisms:

1. **Style Analysis**: The system can analyze these images to extract style characteristics
2. **Inspiration Source**: The creative engine can reference these images when generating new ideas
3. **Training Data**: The style evolution algorithms can use these images as training examples
4. **Evaluation Benchmark**: The critic agent can compare generated art against these references

## Adding New References

When adding new reference images:

1. Place them in the appropriate category folder
2. Follow the naming convention
3. Consider adding metadata
4. Update the collection inventory if one exists
