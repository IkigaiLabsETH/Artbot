# Magritte Art Direction Files

This directory contains category-specific art direction files for the Magritte-inspired art generator. Each file defines the unique characteristics and artistic elements associated with a specific category of René Magritte's work.

## Overview

The art direction files are designed to enhance the quality and authenticity of generated artwork by providing detailed guidance on:

- Style emphasis
- Visual elements
- Color palette
- Composition guidelines
- Mood and tone
- References to Magritte's original works
- Elements to avoid

## Available Categories

The following category-specific art direction files are available:

1. **Classic** (`magritte_classic.json`): Encompasses the quintessential elements of Magritte's surrealism, featuring iconic motifs like bowler hats, pipes, and apples in unexpected contexts.

2. **Empire of Light** (`magritte_empire_of_light.json`): Focuses on the juxtaposition of day and night in a single scene, inspired by Magritte's famous series of paintings.

3. **Landscapes** (`magritte_landscapes.json`): Features surreal Belgian landscapes with impossible elements and dreamlike qualities.

4. **Metamorphosis** (`magritte_metamorphosis.json`): Explores the transformation of objects and beings, blurring the boundaries between different forms.

5. **Mystery** (`magritte_mystery.json`): Emphasizes enigmatic and concealed elements, often featuring hidden or obscured faces and figures.

6. **Objects** (`magritte_objects.json`): Focuses on ordinary objects placed in extraordinary contexts, highlighting their uncanny qualities.

7. **Scale** (`magritte_scale.json`): Plays with the size relationships between objects, featuring dramatically oversized or miniaturized elements.

8. **Silhouettes** (`magritte_silhouettes.json`): Emphasizes dark silhouettes against contrasting backgrounds, often with surreal elements within the silhouette forms.

9. **Skies** (`magritte_skies.json`): Highlights Magritte's distinctive cloud-filled blue skies, often with floating objects or unusual juxtapositions.

10. **Windows** (`magritte_windows.json`): Explores the theme of frames and windows, blurring the distinction between interior and exterior spaces.

11. **Wordplay** (`magritte_wordplay.json`): Focuses on the relationship between images and their meanings, inspired by Magritte's philosophical approach to representation.

## File Structure

Each art direction file follows this JSON structure:

```json
{
  "styleEmphasis": [
    "List of style elements to emphasize"
  ],
  "visualElements": [
    "List of visual elements to include"
  ],
  "colorPalette": [
    "List of colors and color relationships"
  ],
  "compositionGuidelines": [
    "List of composition principles"
  ],
  "moodAndTone": "Description of the mood and tone",
  "references": [
    "List of reference works by Magritte"
  ],
  "avoidElements": [
    "List of elements to avoid"
  ]
}
```

## Usage Guidelines

### Integration with Art Generation

These art direction files should be used to guide the generation process for each category. When a user selects a specific Magritte category, the corresponding art direction file should be loaded and used to influence:

1. The prompt construction
2. The style parameters
3. The composition guidance
4. The post-processing filters

### Maintaining Painterly Quality

Across all categories, maintain these painterly qualities:
- Oil painting technique
- Visible brushstrokes
- Canvas texture
- Traditional painting style
- Non-photorealistic rendering

### Extending Categories

To add a new category:

1. Create a new JSON file following the established structure
2. Define the unique characteristics of the category
3. Include specific references to Magritte's works
4. Update this README to include the new category

## Implementation Notes

When implementing these art direction files in the generation system:

1. Parse the JSON file for the selected category
2. Extract relevant elements based on the generation stage
3. Incorporate the style emphasis and visual elements into the primary prompt
4. Use the color palette and composition guidelines for parameter settings
5. Apply the avoidElements list as negative prompting or post-processing filters

## Examples

For examples of how these art direction files translate into generated artwork, see the `examples` directory, which contains sample images for each category along with the prompts and parameters used to generate them.
