ArtBot is a creative AI system that generates art based on concepts you provide. This version integrates with FLUX, a state-of-the-art text-to-image model available on Replicate.

## Features

- **Concept-to-Art Generation**: Turn your creative concepts into stunning visual artwork
- **AI-Enhanced Prompts**: Detailed art prompts generated by Claude AI
- **Multiple FLUX Variants**: Support for different FLUX model variants (ultra, raw, dev, schnell)
- **High-Resolution Output**: Generate images at 1024x1024 resolution
- **Simple Command-Line Interface**: Easy to use with a single command

## Prerequisites

Before using ArtBot, you'll need:

1. A Replicate API key (sign up at [replicate.com](https://replicate.com))
2. An Anthropic API key (for Claude) or OpenAI API key (as fallback)
3. Node.js installed on your system

## Setup

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your API keys:

```
REPLICATE_API_KEY=your_replicate_api_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Build the project:

```bash
pnpm build
```

## Usage

Run ArtBot using the provided shell script:

```bash
./run-art-generator.sh "your concept" "model-variant"
```

For example:

```bash
./run-art-generator.sh "cosmic garden" "ultra"
```

### Model Variants

ArtBot supports the following FLUX model variants:

- **ultra** (default): High-quality, detailed images with the FLUX 1.1 Pro Ultra model
- **raw**: Photorealistic images with the FLUX 1.1 Pro Ultra model in raw mode
- **dev**: Developer version with the FLUX 1.1 Pro Dev model
- **schnell**: Fast generation with fewer inference steps (4 instead of 28)

Examples:

```bash
# Generate a cosmic garden with the ultra variant
./run-art-generator.sh "cosmic garden" "ultra"

# Generate a surreal dreamscape with the raw variant
./run-art-generator.sh "surreal dreamscape" "raw"

# Generate a cyberpunk city with the schnell variant (faster)
./run-art-generator.sh "cyberpunk city" "schnell"
```

## Output

ArtBot will:

1. Generate a detailed art prompt based on your concept
2. Use FLUX to create an image based on the prompt
3. Save the image URL to a file in the `output` directory
4. Display the URL in the console for you to view the generated image

The output file will be named based on your concept and the model variant used (e.g., `cosmic-garden-ultra.txt`).
